## Step 4: Handle Unsecured SSL Certificate Warning

If you encounter an SSL certificate warning, itâ€™s typically because the server
is using a self-signed or untrusted certificate.

- Click on Proceed or Advanced (depending on your browser) to continue past the warning.

## Step 5: Access the Remote Console

After proceeding past the SSL warning, the IPMI HTML5 interface will load,
allowing you to interact with your server remotely.

You can now monitor the server, reboot, or perform any other remote management tasks.
